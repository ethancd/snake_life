Snake on Fire
==========

They took away your family. They took away your apples. And now, they've set your world on *fire*.

In this heavily pixelated thriller, you play as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game)">Snake</a>, a vigilante with nothing left to lose on an urban rampage through a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_game_of_life">deterministic cellular automaton</a>


Updates
=======
- A full redesign, with an emphasis on simplicity and accessibility. 
- Fire only advances when you move, which lends the game a more tactical and low-pressure feel.
