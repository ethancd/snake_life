Snake/Life
==========

What does an iconic mobile video game have in common with a cellular automaton generator? This project. 
(Also they both originated in the 70's!)

Use the arrow keys or WASD to direct your Snake to eat the "apples" and grow ever longer while avoiding the fires of Life
that rage around you. You can also click on a space to toggle it between living and dead.
