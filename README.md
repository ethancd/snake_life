Snake/Life
==========

What does <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game)">an iconic mobile video game</a> have in common with 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_game_of_life">a cellular automaton generator</a>?
This project. (Also they both originated in the 70's!)

Use the arrow or WASD keys to move your snake around the board collecting 
apples, while being careful to avoid walls, the snake body, or the fire of life 
raging around you. You can also click and drag your mouse through spaces to
toggle whether they're alive -- useful when you need to disrupt a dangerous
formation.
